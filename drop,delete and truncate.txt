    drop column LAST_UPDATED_DATE;


when we use delete it only deletes data from table but structure of table remains there


when we use drop it drops data and structure both from table,,, it just completely drops table and output comes as 
table not exist.


when we use truncate it deletes whole data and output comes as no data found but table still remains there. table
structure still visible to us.
